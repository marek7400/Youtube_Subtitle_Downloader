# Youtube Subtitle Downloader

## 1. Load the movie, turn on subtitles, play, use the plugin to download subtitles.
## 2. If there are no subtitles in the extension window or they are not downloading (but are displayed in the movie), reload the page and try again.
## 3. If subtitles are prepared by the author of the film, they will appear without the note “auto-generated” (they are usually of better quality than those automatically translated by YouTube).
